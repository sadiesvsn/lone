    <h3 class="sub-headings">Early Life</h3>
        <p class="bio">On July 30, 2001, Bobby Wardel Sandimanie III was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He mentions having two younger sisters and an elder brother, but only as half-siblings. He talks of feeling more like an orphan. He was inspired to freestyle by his father, American rapper I-20, as he was growing up. His grandmother, a former teacher, gave him permission to start homeschooling in the sixth grade. In the ninth and tenth years when he returned to school, he remembers misusing the drug Xanax. The "Destroy" component of his stage name is said to have sprung from his belief that his substance abuse was destroying him. He spent most of his early years in solitude which is the origin of "Lonely."</p>
